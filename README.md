# Handwritten-Character-and-Digit-Recognition
Despite the abundance of technological writing tools, many people still choose to take their notes traditionally, with pen and paper. However, there are drawbacks to handwriting text. Itâ€™s difficult to store and access physical documents in an efficient manner, search through them efficiently and to share them with others. Thus, a lot of important knowledge gets lost or does not get reviewed because documents never get transferred to digital format. We have thus decided to tackle this problem in our project because we believe the significantly greater ease of management of digital text compared to written text will help people more effectively access, search, share, and analyze their records, while still allowing them to use their preferred writing method.
